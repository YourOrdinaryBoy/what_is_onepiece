       <b> The Straw Hat Pirates,</b> also known as the <b><u>Mugiwara Pirates</u></b>, <b><u>Straw Hat Crew</u></b> or simply the <b><u>Straw Hats</u></b>, are an <b>infamous</b> and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.

        The <b><u>"Straw Hats"</u></b> are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by <b>Red-Haired Shanks</b> and are first referred to as the <b>Straw Hat Pirates</b> by <b><u>Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom</u></b>. The crew sailed on the <b>Going Merry,</b> <b><u>their first official Straw Hat ship</u></b>, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc,<b> Franky </b> and <b>Iceburg</b> built them a new ship which was named the <b>Thousand Sunny</b> by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.

            Following the events on the <b>Sabaody Archipelago,</b> all the members were separated from one another by <b>Bartholomew Kuma,</b> a <u>then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army</u>. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the <b>New World,</b> greatly disrupting the balance of the <b>Three Great Powers,</b> which would eventually lead to their captain being recognized as one of the <b>Four Emperors.</b>

            <b>The Four Emperors,</b> which make up one of The <b>Three Great Powers,</b> are a group of four pirates <u>considered to be the most notorious and powerful captains in the world</u>. The group currently consists of <b>Red-Haired Shanks, Blackbeard, Straw Hat Luffy and Buggy the Star Clown.</b> Former known members of the group include <b>Whitebeard, Big Mom and Kaidou.</b>

                <b>The Four Emperors</b> are not typically allies, nor are they strictly enemies of one another. Rather, the four prefer to remain autonomous under most circumstances. The Emperors have historically individually resided within the second half of the Grand Line <b>(known as the <i>"New World"</i>)</b>, exerting impressive influence and control over dozens of other pirate crews and self-governing islands. Compared to antagonistic individuals and groups the Straw Hat Pirates face earlier in the series, the Emperors serve as a far bigger threat during the second half of the One Piece series (most notably in the <b>Whole Cake Island Saga</b> and <b>Wano Country Saga</b
>, where <b><u>Big Mom and Kaidou</u></b> serve as the main respective antagonists).

Although <b>Kaidou</b> wished to intervene in the war, he was stopped by <b>Shanks</b>, who then arrived at <u>Marineford and arbitrated a ceasefire</u>. <b>Whitebeard's</b> <i>former subordinate and murderer</i>, <b>Blackbeard</b>, subsequently usurped his position within the following year.
